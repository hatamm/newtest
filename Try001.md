# How to FIDO  <!-- omit in toc -->

_Employing FIDO authenticators and the WebAuthn API in your sign-in flows: A guide for relying parties_

## Let’s Define Some Terms  <!-- omit in toc -->

-  **Account Bootstrapping:** “*Bootstrapping* an account on a
     device”, or “bootstrap sign-in”.  
     Starting from scratch\[1\], a relying party authenticates a user.
     For example, this happens when a user puts their existing account
     on a newly-purchased phone. Or when a user logs into a website for
     the first time in a given browser instance. Or when a user logs
     into a website in a private browsing session (which doesn’t have
     cookies and other state from the main browsing session). Or when a
     user signs into a mobile app for the first time on a given device.
     Note that this is *different* from creating an account with a
     service in the first place.

-  **Reauthentication** happens when a relying party already knows
     who the user is, but would like to reconfirm this. For example,
     this happens before making sensitive changes to an account (add a
     recovery email address, change the passwords, etc.): a relying
     party would typically ask the user to re-enter their password or
     perform some other action to reconfirm their control of the
     session. Likewise, when a mobile app asks the user to sign in
     every time the app starts (or a web site asks the user to sign in
     again after a period of inactivity), this is technically a
     *reauthentication*, since the app or web site can choose to
     remember the user's authentication state after the account has
     been bootstrapped on the device, e.g., by setting cookies.

-  **Relying Party (RP):** The website that is trying to ascertain
     the identity of the user or perform FIDO authentication.
